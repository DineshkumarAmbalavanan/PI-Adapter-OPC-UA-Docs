Export operation actions To limit browsing, specify a comma-separated collection of nodeIds in data source configuration (RootNodeIds). Note: They are treated as roots from where the adapter starts the browse operation. The adapter triggers an export operation after a successful connection to the OPC UA server when the data selection file does not exist in configuration directory. Copy the exported data selection JSON file from the directory or retrieve it using a REST API call. Optional: To avoid a potentially long and expensive browse operation, create the data selection file manually. Configure it before you configure the data source or push both in one configuration call together."

    "keywords": "OSIsoft Adapter for OPC UA principles of operation This topic provides an operational overview of the OPC UA adapter, focusing on streams creation and error handling. Adapter configuration In order for the OPC UA adapter to start data collection, you need to configure the adapter by defining the following: Data source: Provide the data source from which the adapter should collect data. Data selection: Perform selection of OPC UA items to which the adapter should subscribe for data. Logging: Set up the logging attributes to manage the adapter logging behavior. For more information, see OSIsoft Adapter for OPC UA data source configuration and OSIsoft Adapter for OPC UA data selection configuration . Connection The OPC UA adapter uses the binary opc.tcp protocol to communicate with the OPC UA servers. When a secured connection is enabled, the X.509-type client and server certificates are exchanged and verified and the connection between the OPC UA adapter and the configured OPC UA server is established. Stream creation The OPC UA adapter creates types upon receiving the value update for a stream. One stream is created for every selected OPC UA item in the data selection configuration. Data collection The OPC UA adapter collects time-series data from selected OPC UA dynamic variables through OPC UA subscriptions (unsolicited reads). The adapter supports the Data Access (DA) part of OPC UA specification. Streams by OPC UA adapter The OPC UA adapter creates a stream with two properties per selected OPC UA item. The properties are described in the following table: Property name Data type Description Timestamp DateTime Timestamp of the given OPC UA item value update. Value Based on type of incoming OPC UA value Value of the given OPC UA item update. Stream ID is a unique identifier for each stream created by the adapter for a given OPC UA item. If the Custom Stream ID is specified for the OPC UA item in data selection configuration, the OPC UA adapter uses that as a stream ID for the stream. Otherwise, the adapter constructs the stream ID using the following format constructed from the OPC UA item node ID: <Adapter Component ID>.<Namespace>.<Identifier> Note: The naming convention is affected by StreamPrefix and ApplyPrefixToStreamID settings in data source configuration. For more information, see OSIsoft Adapter for OPC UA data source configuration ."

While the files are accessible to view, OSIsoft recommends that you use REST or the edgecmd command line tool for any changes you make to the files. As part of making adapters as secure as possible, any passwords or secrets that you configure are stored in encrypted form (with cryptographic key material stored separately in a secure location.) If you edit the files directly, the adapter may not work as expected. Note: You can edit any single component or facet of the system using REST, but also configure the system as a whole with a single REST call. Configure system components The default System_Components.json file for the System component contains the following information. [ { \"ComponentId\": \"OmfEgress\", \"ComponentType\": \"OmfEgress\" } ] Note: The OmfEgress component is required for this initial release for adapters to run. You can add additional components if you want, but only a single OmfEgress component is supported. Complete the following to add a new component: Using any text editor, create a file that contains the system components configuration in JSON form. For content structure, see System components example . The following example adds a Modbus TCP adapter. { \"ComponentId\": \"Modbus1\", \"ComponentType\": \"Modbus\" } Note: A unique ComponentId is necessary for each component in the system.

OSIsoft adapters are supported on platforms that lack this capability. It is particularly useful for learning more about OSIsoft adapter REST APIs. C#, Python, Go You can use any modern programming language to make REST calls to administer and write programs for OSIsoft adapters. System tools Many OSIsoft customers use Windows computers, even though they may deploy Linux devices to host OSIsoft adapters. You can install OSIsoft adapters on Windows 10, and the same custom applications developed on Windows should work on Linux, as long as the application development environment is supported on Linux. OSIsoft adapters have been designed to use platform independent programming. To facilitate working with Linux devices, Windows tools like PuTTY and WinSCP are very useful for copying files and remotely accessing Linux command lines."

    "keywords": "OSIsoft Adapter for OPC UA security configuration The OPC UA security standard is concerned with the authentication of client and server applications, the authentication of users and confidentiality of their communication. As the security model relies heavily on Transport Level Security (TLS) to establish a secure communication link with an OPC UA server, each client, including the OSIsoft adapter, must have a digital certificate deployed and configured. Certificates uniquely identify client applications and machines on servers, and allow for creation of a secure communication link when trusted on both sides. OPC UA adapter generates a self-signed certificate when the first secure connection attempt is made. Each OPC UA adapter instance creates a certificate store where its own certificates, as well as those of the server, will be persisted. Configure OPC UA adapter security In your data source configuration, set UseSecureConnection to true . For more information, see OSIsoft Adapter for OPC UA data source configuration . The adapter verifies whether the server certificate is present in the adapter trusted certificates folder and is therefore trusted. In case the certificates were not exchanged before the first attemped connection, the adapter persists the server certificate within the adapter rejected certificates folder and the following warning message about the rejected server certificate will be printed: ~~2019-09-08 11:45:48.093 +01:00~~ [Warning] Rejected Certificate: \"DC=MyServer.MyDomain.int, O=Prosys OPC, CN=Simulation Manually move the server certificate from the RejectedCertificates\\certs folder to the Trusted\\certs folder using a file explorer or command-line interpreter. Linux example using command-line: mv /usr/share/OSIsoft/Adapters/OpcUa/OpcUa/OpcUa1/Certificates/RejectedCertificates/certsSimulationServer\\ \\[F9823DCF607063DBCECCF6F8F39FD2584F46AEBB\\].der /usr/share/OSIsoft/Adapters/OpcUa/OpcUa/OpcUa1/Certificates/Trusted/certs/ Note: Administrator or root privileges are required to perform this operation. Once the certificate is in the adapter trusted certificates folder, the adapter trusts the server and the connection attempt proceeds in making the connection call to the configured server. Add the certificate of the adapter to the server's trust store. The connection succeeds only when the adapter certificate is trusted on the server side. For more details on how to make a client certificate trusted, see your OPC UA server documentation. In general, servers work in a similar fashion as the clients, hence you can take a similar approach for making the server certificate trusted on the client side. When certificates are mutually trusted, the connection attempt succeeds and the adapter is connected to the most secure endpoint provided by the server.

Configure OPC UA data source Note: You cannot modify OPC UA data source configurations manually. You must use the REST endpoints to add or edit the configuration. Complete the following to configure the OPC UA data source: Using any text editor, create a file that contains an OPC UA data source in JSON form. For content structure, see OPC UA data source example . For a table of all available parameters, see OPC UA data source parameters . Save the file, for example as DataSource.config.json . Use any of the Configuration tools capable of making HTTP requests to execute a POST command with the contents of that file to the following endpoint: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/<adapterId>/DataSource/ . Example using curl (run this command from the same directory where the file is located): Note: During installation, you can add a single OPC UA adapter named OpcUa1. The following example uses this component name. curl -v -d \"@DataSource.config.json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \"http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/OpcUa1/DataSource\" Note: After you have completed data source configuration, the next step is to configure data selection. You can either have a default data selection file generated or you can create the data selection file yourself. For more information, see OSIsoft Adapter for OPC UA data selection configuration . OPC UA data source schema The following table shows the basic behavior of the OpcUa_DataSource_schema.json file. Abstract Extensible Status Identifiable Custom properties Additional properties Can be instantiated Yes Experimental No Forbidden Forbidden The full schema definition for the OPC UA data source configuration is in the OpcUa_DataSource_schema.json here: Windows: %Program Files%\\OSIsoft\\Adapters\\OpcUa\\Schemas Linux: /opt/OSIsoft/Adapters/OpcUa/Schemas OPC UA data source parameters The following parameters can be used to configure an OPC UA data source: Parameter Required Type Nullable Description EndpointURL Required string Yes The endpoint URL of the OPC UA server. The following is an example of the URL format: opc.tcp://OPCServerHost:Port/OpcUa/SimulationServer Note: If you change the EndpointURL on a configured OPC UA adapter that has ComponentID_DataSelection.json file exported, you need to remove the ComponentID_DataSelection.json file from the configuration directory to trigger a new browse (export). UseSecureConnection Optional boolean No When set to true, the OPC UA adapter connects to a secure endpoint using OPC UA certificate exchange operation. The default is true. When set to false, the OPC UA adapter connects to an unsecured endpoint of the server and certificate exchange operation is not required. Note: OSIsoft recommends setting this option to false for testing purposes only. UserName Optional string Yes User name for accessing the OPC UA server. Password Optional string Yes Password for accessing the OPC UA server. Note: OSIsoft recommends using REST to configure the data source when the password must be specified. RootNodeIds Optional string Yes List of comma-separated NodeIds of those objects from which the OPC UA adapter browses the OPC UA server address space. This option allows selecting only subsets of the OPC UA address by explicitly listing one or more NodeIds which are used to start the initial browse. For example: ns=5;s=85/0:Simulation, ns=3;s=DataItems. If not specified, it means that the whole address space will be browsed. IncomingTimestamp Optional string No Specifies whether the incoming timestamp is taken from the source, from the OPC UA server, or should be created by the OPC UA adapter instance. Source - Default and recommended setting. The timestamp is taken from the source timestamp field. The source is what provides data for the item to the OPC UA server, such as a field device. Server - In case the OPC UA item has an invalid source timestamp field, the Server timestamp can be used. Connector - The OPC UA adapter generates a timestamp for the item upon receiving it from the OPC UA server. StreamPrefix Optional string Yes Specifies what prefix is used for Stream IDs and names. Naming convention is StreamPrefixNodeId and StreamPrefixName. Note: An empty string means no prefix will be added to the Stream IDs and names. Null value means ComponentID followed by dot character will be added to the stream IDs and names (for example, OpcUa1.NodeId). ApplyPrefixToStreamId Optional boolean No Parameter applied to all data items collected from the data source that have custom stream ID configured. If configured, the adapter will apply the StreamIdPrefix property to all the streams with custom ID configured. The property does not affect any streams with default ID configured OPC UA data source example The following is an example of valid OPC UA data source configuration: { \"EndpointUrl\": \"opc.tcp://IP-Address/TestOPCUAServer\", \"UseSecureConnection\": true, \"UserName\": null, \"Password\": null, \"RootNodeIds\": null, \"IncomingTimestamp\": \"Source\", \"StreamPrefix\": null, \"ApplyPrefixToStreamId\": false }"

    "keywords": "OSIsoft Adapter for OPC UA data selection configuration In addition to the data source configuration, you need to provide a data selection configuration to specify the data you want the OPC UA adapter to collect from the data sources. When you add a data source, the OPC UA adapter browses the entire OPC UA server address space and exports the available OPC UA variables into a JSON file for data selection. Data is collected automatically based upon user demands. OPC UA data from OPC UA variables is read through subscriptions (unsolicited reads). You can either have the data selection configuration file generated for you or you can create it manually yourself. Generate default OPC UA data selection configuration file A default OPC UA data selection file will be created if there is no OPC UA data selection configuration, but a valid OPC UA data source exists. Note: To avoid possibly expensive browse operations, OSIsoft recommends that you manually create a data selection file instead of generating the default data selection file. For more information, see Configure OPC UA data selection . Complete the following steps in order for this default data selection file to be generated: Add an OPC UA adapter with a unique ComponentId. For more information, see System components configuration . During the installation of Edge Data Store, enabling the OPC UA adapter results in addition of a unique component that also satisfies this condition. Configure a valid OPC UA data source. For more information, see OSIsoft Adapter for OPC UA data source configuration . Once you complete these steps, a default OPC UA data selection configuration file will be generated in the configuration directory for the corresponding platform.

Configure logging To change the logging configuration complete the following steps: Using any text editor, create a file that contains the logging configuration in JSON form. For content structure, see Example Default logging configuration . For all available parameters, see Logging parameters . Save the file, for example as Component_Logging.json . Use any of the Configuration tools capable of making HTTP requests to execute a PUT command with the contents of that file to the following endpoint: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/<ComponentId>/Logging . Note: Replace <ComponentId> with the ComponentId of the adapter, for example OpcUa1 . Example using curl (run this command from the same directory where the file is located): curl -i -d \"@Component_Logging.json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X PUT http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/<ComponentId>/Logging On successful execution, the log level change takes effect immediately during runtime. The other configurations (log file size and file count) get updated after the adapter is restarted. Note: Any parameter not specified in the updated configuration file will revert to the default schema value. Logging schema The full schema definition for the logging configuration is in the component specific logging file: AdapterName_Logging_schema.json , OmfEgress_Logging_schema.json , or System_Logging_schema.json here: Windows: %Program Files%\\OSIsoft\\Adapters\\AdapterName\\Schemas Linux: /opt/OSIsoft/Adapters/AdapterName/Schemas Logging parameters Parameter Required Type Description logLevel Optional reference The logLevel sets the minimum severity for messages to be included in the logs. Messages with a severity below the level set are not included. The log levels in their increasing order of severity are as follows: Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical. For detailed information about the logLevels, see LogLevel . logFileSizeLimitBytes Optional integer The maximum size in bytes of log files that the service will create for the component. It must be a positive integer. logFileCountLimit Optional integer The maximum number of log files that the service will create for the component. It must be a positive integer. LogLevel Level Description Trace Logs that contain the most detailed messages. These messages may contain sensitive application data like actual received values, which is why these messages shouldn’t be enabled in production environment. Debug Logs that can be used to troubleshoot data flow issues by recording metrics and detailed flow related information. Information Logs that track the general flow of the application. Any non-repetitive general information (like version information relating to the software at startup, what external services are being used, data source connection string, number of measurements, egress URL, change of state “Starting”, “Stopping”, or configuration) can be useful for diagnosing potential application errors. Warning Logs that highlight an abnormal or unexpected event in the application flow, but does not otherwise cause the application execution to stop. Warning messages can indicate an unconfigured data source state, that a communication with backup failover instance has been lost, an insecure communication channel in use, or any other event that could require attention, but that does not impact data flow. Error Logs that highlight when the current flow of execution is stopped due to a failure. These should indicate a failure in the current activity, not an application-wide failure. This can indicate an invalid configuration, unavailable external endpoint, internal flow error, and so on. Critical Logs that describe an unrecoverable application or system crash, or a catastrophic failure that requires immediate attention. This can indicate application wide failures like beta timeout expired, unable to start self-hosted endpoint, unable to access vital resource (for example, Data Protection key file), and so on. Example Default logging configuration By default, logging captures Information, Warning, Error, and Critical messages in the message logs. The following logging configuration is the default for a component on install: { \"logLevel\": \"Information\", \"logFileSizeLimitBytes\": 34636833, \"logFileCountLimit\": 31 }"
