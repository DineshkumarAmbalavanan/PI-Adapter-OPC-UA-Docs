Export operation actions To limit browsing, specify a comma-separated collection of nodeIds in data source configuration (RootNodeIds). Note: They are treated as roots from where the adapter starts the browse operation. The adapter triggers an export operation after a successful connection to the OPC UA server when the data selection file does not exist in configuration directory. Copy the exported data selection JSON file from the directory or retrieve it using a REST API call. Optional: To avoid a potentially long and expensive browse operation, create the data selection file manually. Configure it before you configure the data source or push both in one configuration call together."

    "keywords": "PI Adapter for OPC UA data selection configuration In addition to the data source configuration, you need to provide a data selection configuration to specify the data you want the adapter to collect from the data sources. When you add a data source, the adapter browses the entire OPC UA server address space and exports the available OPC UA variables into a JSON file for data selection. Comma-separated collection of nodeIds (RootNodeIds) serve as filters to browse only a subset of the OPC UA server. Data is collected automatically based upon user demands. OPC UA data from OPC UA variables is read through subscriptions (unsolicited reads). You can decide to have the data selection configuration file generated automatically or you can create it manually yourself. Generate default OPC UA data selection configuration file A default OPC UA data selection file will be created if there is no OPC UA data selection configuration although a valid data source exists. Note: To avoid possible time and resource expensive browse operations due to reasons described previously, OSIsoft recommends that you manually create a data selection file instead of automatically creating the default data selection file. For more information, see Configure OPC UA data selection . Complete the following procedure for this default data selection file to be generated: Add an OPC UA adapter with a unique ComponentId.

The following is an example of the URL format: opc.tcp://OPCServerHost:Port/OpcUa/SimulationServer Note: If you change the EndpointURL on a configured adapter that has ComponentID_DataSelection .json file exported, you need to remove the ComponentID_DataSelection.json file from the configuration directory to trigger a new browse (export). Allowed value: well-formed opc.tcp address UseSecureConnection Optional boolean When set to true, the adapter connects to a secure endpoint using OPC UA certificate exchange operation. The default is true. When set to false, the adapter connects to an unsecured endpoint of the server and certificate exchange operation is not required. Note: OSIsoft recommends setting this option to false for testing purposes only. Allowed value: true or false Default value: true UserName Optional string User name for accessing the OPC UA server. Allowed value: any string Default value: null Password Optional string Password for accessing the OPC UA server. Note: OSIsoft recommends using REST to configure the data source when the password must be specified because REST will encrypt the password. If you do not use REST, the plain text password will be stored on-disk. Allowed value: any string Default value: null RootNodeIds Optional string List of comma-separated NodeIds of those objects from which the adapter browses the OPC UA server address space. This option allows to select only subsets of the OPC UA address by explicitly listing one or more NodeIds which are used to start the initial browse. Examples: \"ns=5;s=85/0:Simulation\" \"ns=3;s=DataItems\" If not specified, it means that the whole address space will be browsed. Allowed value: comma-separated collection of node Ids Default value: null IncomingTimestamp Optional string Specifies whether the incoming timestamp is taken from the source, from the OPC UA server, or should be created by the adapter instance. Source - Default and recommended setting. The timestamp is taken from the source timestamp field. The source is what provides data for the item to the OPC UA server, such as a field device. Server - In case the OPC UA item has an invalid source timestamp field, the Server timestamp can be used. Adapter - The adapter generates a timestamp for the item upon receiving it from the OPC UA server. Allowed value: Source , Server , or Adapter Default value: Source StreamIdPrefix Optional string Specifies what prefix is used for Stream IDs. The naming convention is StreamIdPrefix.StreamId. An empty string means no prefix will be added to the Stream IDs and names. Null value defaults to ComponentID followed by a dot, for example, OpcUa1 .NamespaceIndex.Identifier. Note: Every time you change the StreamIdPrefix of a configured adapter, for example when you delete and add a data source, you need to restart the adapter for the changes to take place. New streams are created on adapter restart and pre-existing streams are no longer updated. Allowed value: any string Default value: null DefaultStreamIdPattern Optional string Specifies the default stream Id pattern to use. Possible parameters: {NamespaceIndex}, {Identifier}, {Name}.

    "title": "PI Adapter for OPC UA security configuration",
    "keywords": "PI Adapter for OPC UA security configuration The OPC UA security standard is concerned with the authentication of client and server applications, the authentication of users and confidentiality of their communication. As the security model relies heavily on Transport Level Security (TLS) to establish a secure communication link with an OPC UA server, each client, including the adapter, must have a digital certificate deployed and configured. Certificates uniquely identify client applications and machines on servers, and allow for creation of a secure communication link when trusted on both sides. The adapter generates a self-signed certificate when the first secure connection attempt is made. The adapter's certificates and those of the server are stored in the certificate store which is shared between all adapter instances. Configure OPC UA adapter security Complete the following procedure to configure adapter security: In your data source configuration, set UseSecureConnection to true . For more information, see PI Adapter for OPC UA data source configuration . The adapter verifies whether the server certificate is present in the adapter trusted certificates and hence trusts it. In case the certificates were not exchanged before the first attempted connection, the adapter persists the server certificate within the adapter rejected certificates folder. The following warning message about the rejected server certificate will be printed: ~~2019-09-08 11:45:48.093 +01:00~~ [Warning] Rejected Certificate: \"DC=MyServer.MyDomain.int, O=OSIsoft, CN=Simulation Manually move the server certificate from the Adapter rejected certificates location to the Adapter trusted certificates location using a file explorer or command-line interpreter. Linux example using command-line: sudo mv /usr/share/OSIsoft/Adapters/OpcUa/Certificates/rejected/certs/'SimulationServer [F9823DCF607063DBCECCF6F8F39FD2584F46AEBB].der' /usr/share/OSIsoft/Adapters/OpcUa/Certificates/trusted/certs/ Note: Administrator or root privileges are required to perform this operation. Once the certificate is in the adapter trusted certificates folder, the adapter trusts the server and the connection attempt proceeds in making the connection call to the configured server. Add the certificate of the adapter to the server's trust store. The connection succeeds only when the adapter certificate is trusted on the server side. For more details on how to make a client certificate trusted, see your OPC UA server documentation. In general, servers work in a similar fashion to the clients, hence you can take a similar approach for making the client certificate trusted on the server side. When certificates are mutually trusted, the connection attempt succeeds and the adapter is connected to the most secure endpoint provided by the server.

    "keywords": "PI Adapter for OPC UA overview The PI Adapter for OPC UA is a data-collection component that transfers time-series data from source devices to OMF endpoints in OSIsoft Cloud Services or PI Servers. OPC UA (OPC Unified Architecture) is an open standard, machine-to-machine communication protocol for industrial automation developed by the OPC Foundation. The adapter can connect to any device that uses the OPC UA communication protocol. The adapter is installed with a download kit obtained from the OSIsoft Customer Portal and works on devices running either Windows or Linux operating systems. All functions of the adapter are configured using REST API. The configurations are stored in JSON files. For data ingress, an adapter component must be defined in the system components configuration for each device to which the adapter will connect. Each adapter component is then configured with the connection information for the device and the data to collect. For data egress, configuration is needed to specify destinations for the data, including security for the outgoing connection. Additional configurations are available to egress health and diagnostics data, add buffering configuration to protect against data loss, and record logging information for troubleshooting purposes. Once the adapter is configured and sending data, administration functions are used to manage the adapter or individual ingress components of the adapter. Health and diagnostics functions monitor the status of connected devices, adapter system functions, the number of active data streams, the rate of data ingress, the rate of errors, and the rate of data egress. The EdgeCmd utility is an OSIsoft proprietary command line tool that is used to configure and administer an adapter on both Linux and Windows operating systems. It is installed separately from the adapter. <!-- # PI Adapter for OPC UA ======= - [PI Adapter for OPC UA overview](xref:PIAdapterForOPCUAOverview) - [PI Adapter for OPC UA principles of operation](xref:PIAdapterForOPCUAPrinciplesOfOperation) - [Installation](xref:Installation) - [Install the adapter](xref:InstallTheAdapter) - [Install PI Adapter for OPC UA using Docker](xref:InstallPIAdapterForOPCUAUsingDocker) - [Uninstall the adapter](xref:UninstallTheAdapter) - [Configuration](xref:OPCUAConfiguration) - [Configuration tools](xref:ConfigurationTools) - [System components configuration](xref:SystemComponentsConfiguration) - [PI Adapter for OPC UA data source configuration](xref:PIAdapterForOPCUADataSourceConfiguration) - [PI Adapter for OPC UA data selection configuration](xref:PIAdapterForOPCUADataSelectionConfiguration) - [PI Adapter for OPC UA security configuration](xref:PIAdapterForOPCUASecurityConfiguration) - [Egress endpoints configuration](xref:EgressEndpointsConfiguration) - [Health endpoint configuration](xref:HealthEndpointConfiguration) - [Diagnostics configuration](xref:DiagnosticsConfiguration) - [Buffering configuration](xref:BufferingConfiguration) - [Logging configuration](xref:LoggingConfiguration) - [System and adapter configuration](xref:SystemAndAdapterConfiguration) - [Administration](xref:Administration) - [Start and stop an adapter](xref:StartAndStopAnAdapter) - [Start and stop ingress component](xref:StartAndStopIngressComponent) - [Retrieve product version information](xref:RetrieveProductVersionInformation) - [Delete an adapter component](xref:DeleteAnAdapterComponent) - [Health and diagnostics](xref:HealthAndDiagnostics) - [Adapter health](xref:AdapterHealth) - [Device status](xref:DeviceStatus) - [Next health message expected](xref:NextHealthMessageExpected) - [Adapter diagnostics](xref:AdapterDiagnostics) - [System](xref:System) - [Stream count](xref:StreamCount) - [IO rate](xref:IORate) - [Error rate](xref:ErrorRate) - [Egress diagnostics](xref:EgressDiagnostics) -->"

Create a Docker container containing the OPC UA adapter Create the following Dockerfile in the directory where you want to create and run the container. Note: Dockerfile is the required name of the file. Use the variation according to your operating system: ARM32 FROM ubuntu WORKDIR / RUN apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libicu60 libssl1.0.0 COPY opcuadockerstart.sh / RUN chmod +x /opcuadockerstart.sh ADD ./OpcUa_linux-arm.tar.gz . ENTRYPOINT [\"/opcuadockerstart.sh\"] ARM64 FROM ubuntu WORKDIR / RUN apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libicu60 libssl1.0.0 COPY opcuadockerstart.sh / RUN chmod +x /opcuadockerstart.sh ADD ./OpcUa_linux-arm64.tar.gz . ENTRYPOINT [\"/opcuadockerstart.sh\"] AMD64 (x64) FROM ubuntu WORKDIR / RUN apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libicu60 libssl1.0.0 COPY opcuadockerstart.sh / RUN chmod +x /opcuadockerstart.sh ADD ./OpcUa_linux-x64.tar.gz . ENTRYPOINT [\"/opcuadockerstart.sh\"] Copy the OpcUa_linux-<platform>.tar.gz file to the same directory as the Dockerfile. Copy the opcuadockerstart.sh script to the same directory. Run the following command line in the same directory (sudo may be necessary): docker build -t opcuaadapter . Run the OPC UA adapter Docker container REST access from the local host to the Docker container Complete the following to run the container: Use the docker container image opcuaadapter created previously. Type the following in the command line (sudo may be necessary): docker run -d --network host opcuaadapter Port 5590 is accessible from the host and you can make REST calls to OPC UA adapter from applications on the local host computer. In this example, all data stored by the OPC UA adapter is stored in the container itself. When the container is deleted, the data stored is also deleted. Provide persistent storage for the Docker container Complete the following to run the container: Use the docker container image opcuaadapter created previously. Type the following in the command line (sudo may be necessary): docker run -d --network host -v /opcua:/usr/share/OSIsoft/ opcuaadapter Port 5590 is accessible from the host and you can make REST calls to OPC UA adapter from applications on the local host computer. In this example, all data that is written to the container is instead written to the host directory. In this example, the host directory is a directory on the local machine, /opcua . You can specify any directory. Port number change To use a different port other than 5590 you can specify a portnum variable on the docker run command line. For example, to start the adapter using port 6000 instead of 5590, you use the command line: docker run -d -e portnum=6000 --network host opcuaadapter Instead of accessing the REST API using port 5590 you use port 6000. The following curl command returns the configuration for the container. curl http://localhost:6000/api/v1/configuration Remove REST access to the Docker container If you remove the --network host option from the docker run command, no REST access is possible from outside the container. This may be of value where you want to host an application in the same container as OPC UA adapter and do not want to have external REST access enabled."

This release of { product name } is the highest quality and most secure version of the { product name } released to date. OSIsoft's commitment to improving the PI System is ongoing, and each future version should raise the quality and security bar even further. Vulnerability Communication The practice of publicly disclosing internally discovered vulnerabilities is consistent with the Common Industrial Control System Vulnerability Disclosure Framework developed by the Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group (ICSJWG). Despite the increased risk posed by greater transparency, OSIsoft is sharing this information to help you make an informed decision about when to upgrade to ensure your PI System has the best available protection. For more information, refer to OSIsoft’s Ethical Disclosure Policy (https://www.osisoft.com/ethical-disclosure-policy) . To report a security vulnerability, refer to OSIsoft's Report a Security Vulnerability (https://www.osisoft.com/report-a-security-vulnerability) . Vulnerability Scoring OSIsoft has selected the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to quantify the severity of security vulnerabilities for disclosure. To calculate the CVSS scores, OSIsoft uses the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) calculator maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). OSIsoft uses High, Medium and Low categories to aggregate the CVSS Base scores. This removes some of the opinion related errors of CVSS scoring. As noted in the CVSS specification, Base score range from 0 for the lowest severity to 10 for the highest severity.

Note: The OmfEgress component is required for this initial release for adapters to run. You can add additional components, but only a single OmfEgress component is supported. The following example adds a Modbus TCP adapter: { \"ComponentId\": \"Modbus1\", \"ComponentType\": \"Modbus\" } Note: A unique ComponentId is necessary for each component in the system. This example uses the ComponentId Modbus1 since it is the first Modbus TCP adapter to be added. Save the file. For example, AddComponent.json . Use any of the Configuration tools capable of making HTTP requests to run either a POST or PUT command to their appropriate endpoint. Note: 5590 is the default port number. If you selected a different port number, replace it with that value. POST endpoint: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/system/components Example using curl : Note: Run this command from the same directory where the file is located. curl -d \"@AddComponent.json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST \"http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/system/components\" PUT endpoint: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/system/components/<componentId> Example using curl : Note: Run this command from the same directory where the file is located. curl -d \"@AddComponent.json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X PUT \"http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/system/components/Modbus1\" After the curl command completes successfully, you can configure or use the new component. Update system components Complete the following steps to update the system components, for example, by adding or deleting components. Using any text editor, create a file that contains the current system components configuration. For information on how to retrieve the system components configuration, see REST URLs . Delete or add components as you need. Note: You cannot delete the OmfEgress component. Save the file. For example, UpdateComponents.json Use any of the Configuration tools capable of making HTTP requests to run a PUT command with the contents of the file to the following endpoint: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/system/components Note: 5590 is the default port number. If you selected a different port number, replace it with that value. Example using curl : Note: Run this command from the same directory where the file is located. curl -d \"@UpdateComponents.json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X PUT \"http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/system/components\" Delete a system component Complete the following steps to delete an existing component: Start any of the Configuration tools capable of making HTTP requests. Run a DELETE command to the following endpoint, replacing <ComponentId> with the ID of the component that you want to delete: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/system/components/<ComponentId>/ Note: 5590 is the default port number. If you selected a different port number, replace it with that value. Example using curl : Note: Run this command from the same directory where the file is located. Delete OpcUa1 component curl -X DELETE \"http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/system/components/OpcUa1/\" All the logs and configurations files for the deleted components are moved to the corresponding logs/Removed or Configuration/Removed folder. System components schema The full schema definition for the system components configuration is in the System_Components_schema.json file located in one of the following folders: Windows: %ProgramFiles%\\OSIsoft\\Adapters\\AdapterName\\Schemas Linux: /opt/OSIsoft/Adapters/AdapterName/Schemas System components parameters The following parameters are available for configuring system components: Parameters Required Type Description ComponentId Required string The ID of the component. It can be any alphanumeric string, for example, OmfEgress. A properly configured ComponentID follows these rules: Cannot contain leading or trailing space Cannot use the following characters: > < / : ? # [ ] @ ! $ & * \\ \" ( ) \\\\ + , ; = \\| ` { } ComponentType Required string The type of the component, for example, OmfEgress. There are two types of components: OmfEgress and the adapter. Examples Default system components configuration The default System_Components.json file for the System component contains the following information. [ { \"ComponentId\": \"OmfEgress\", \"ComponentType\": \"OmfEgress\" } ] System components configuration with two adapter instances [ { \"componentId\": \"Modbus1\", \"componentType\": \"Modbus\" }, { \"componentId\": \"Modbus2\", \"componentType\": \"Modbus\" }, { \"ComponentId\": \"OmfEgress\", \"ComponentType\": \"OmfEgress\" } ] REST URLs Relative URL HTTP verb Action api/v1/configuration/system/components GET Retrieves the system components configuration api/v1/configuration/system/components POST Adds a new component to the system configuration api/v1/configuration/system/components PUT Updates the system components configuration api/v1/configuration/system/components/ componentId DELETE Deletes a specific component from the system components configuration api/v1/configuration/system/components/ componentId PUT Creates a new component with the specified componentId in the system configuration"

Adapter configuration For the OPC UA adapter to start data collection, configure the following: Data source: Provide the data source from which the adapter should collect data. Data selection: Perform selection of OPC UA items to which the adapter should subscribe for data. Logging: Set up the logging attributes to manage the adapter logging behavior. For more information, see PI Adapter for OPC UA data source configuration and PI Adapter for OPC UA data selection configuration . Connection The OPC UA adapter uses the binary opc.tcp protocol to communicate with the OPC UA servers. When a secured connection is enabled, the X.509-type client and server certificates are exchanged and verified and the connection between the OPC UA adapter and the configured OPC UA server is established. For more information on secure connections, see PI Adapter for OPC UA security configuration . Data collection The OPC UA adapter collects time-series data from selected OPC UA dynamic variables through OPC UA subscriptions (unsolicited reads). The adapter supports the Data Access (DA) part of OPC UA specification. For more information, see Unified Architecture (https://opcfoundation.org/developer-tools/specifications-unified-architecture/part-8-data-access) . Data types The following table lists OPC UA variable types that the adapter supports data collection from and types of streams that will be created. OPC UA data type Stream data type Boolean Boolean Byte Int16 SByte Int16 Int16 Int16 UInt16 UInt16 Int32 Int32 UInt32 UInt32 Int64 Int64 UInt64 UInt64 Float Float32 Double Float64 DateTime DateTime String String Stream creation The OPC UA adapter creates types upon receiving the value update for a stream. One stream is created for every selected OPC UA item in the data selection configuration. Streams by OPC UA adapter The OPC UA adapter creates a stream with two properties for each selected OPC UA item. The properties are described in the following table: Property name Data type Description Timestamp DateTime Timestamp of the given OPC UA item value update. Value Based on type of incoming OPC UA value Value of the given OPC UA item update. Certain metadata are sent with each stream created. Metadata common for every adapter type are ComponentId : Specifies the data source, for example OpcUa1 ComponentType : Specifies the type of adapter, for example OpcUa Metadata specific to the OPC UA adapter are BrowseName : The browse name as provided by the OPC UA server SourceId : The NodeId provided by the OPC UA server Note: The metadata level is set in General configuration . For the OPC UA adapter, the following metadata is sent for the individual level: None : No metadata Low : AdapterType (ComponentType) and DataSource (ComponentId) Medium : AdapterType (ComponentType), DataSource (ComponentId), BrowseName, and DisplayName High : AdapterType (ComponentType), DataSource (ComponentId), BrowseName, DisplayName, and SourceId Each stream created by the adapter for a given OPC UA item has a unique identifier (Stream ID). If a custom stream ID is specified for the OPC UA item in data selection configuration, the OPC UA adapter uses that stream ID to create the stream. Otherwise, the adapter constructs the stream ID using the following format, which is constructed from the OPC UA item node ID: <Adapter Component ID>.<NamespaceIndex>.<Identifier> Note: The naming convention is affected by StreamPrefix and ApplyPrefixToStreamID settings in data source configuration.

OPC UA (OPC Unified Architecture) is an open standard, machine-to-machine communication protocol for industrial automation developed by the OPC Foundation. The adapter can connect to any device that uses the OPC UA communication protocol. The adapter is installed with a download kit obtained from the OSIsoft Customer Portal and works on devices running either Windows or Linux operating systems. All functions of the adapter are configured using REST API. The configurations are stored in JSON files. For data ingress, an adapter component must be defined in the system components configuration for each device to which the adapter will connect. Each adapter component is then configured with the connection information for the device and the data to collect. For data egress, configuration is needed to specify destinations for the data, including security for the outgoing connection. Additional configurations are available to egress health and diagnostics data, add buffering configuration to protect against data loss, and record logging information for troubleshooting purposes. Once the adapter is configured and sending data, administration functions are used to manage the adapter or individual ingress components of the adapter. Health and diagnostics functions monitor the status of connected devices, adapter system functions, the number of active data streams, the rate of data ingress, the rate of errors, and the rate of data egress. The EdgeCmd utility is an OSIsoft proprietary command line tool that is used to configure and administer an adapter on both Linux and Windows operating systems. It is installed separately from the adapter."
